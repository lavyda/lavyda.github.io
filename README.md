# That's me
This is the attempt for my personal webpage ðŸ˜†

Created with the help of [argyleink](https://github.com/argyleink)'s simple yet awesome [shortstack](https://github.com/argyleink/shortstack)

## Development
Running `npm start` runs Browsersync, which watches changes to your files in `./app` and refreshes connected browsers.

## Production
Running `npm run build` compiles and minifies your code in `app` and outputs the optimised result to a folder called `dist` that's ready for static hosting.
